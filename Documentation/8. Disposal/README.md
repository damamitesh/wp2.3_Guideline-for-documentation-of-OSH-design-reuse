# **Disposal**

*I would like to enable makers to understand the process of discarding (getting rid of) something we no longer need or want.* 

## **How to document a disposal process?**

*Disposal instructions can guide the makers to provide the minimum documentation for disposal of a product or its disposable components*

*The purpose of the disposal process is to remove a system element from the operating environment with the intent of permanently terminating its use; and to deal with any hazardous or toxic materials or waste products following the applicable guidance, policy, regulation, and statutes.*
