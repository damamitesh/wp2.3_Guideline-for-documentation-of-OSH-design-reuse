# **Disposal**

*I would like to enable makers to understand the process of discarding (getting rid of) something that we no longer need or want.* 

## **How to document a disposal process?**

*Disposal instructions can guide the makers to provide the minimum documentation for disposal of a product or its disposable components*

*The purpose of the disposal process is to remove a system element from the operating environment with the intent of permanent termination of its use. This process can deal with any hazardous or toxic materials or waste products following the applicable guidance, policy, regulation, and statutes.*
