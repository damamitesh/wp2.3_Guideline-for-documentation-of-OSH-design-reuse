# **Disposal**

*I would like to enable makers to understand the process of discarding (getting rid of) something we no longer need or want.* 

## **How to document a dispol process?**

*Diposable product are designed for single use, which means they get discarded ("disposed of") immediately after use. Disposable products can have severely negative consequences on the environment if sustainability isn't factored into disposal options.*

#### *1. Material selection*

 - **Definition:** *Material selection is a step in the process of designing and manufacturing any physical object. The main goal of material selection is to use the critical requirements of each part to define the performance requirement of the material.*

```
What does comprise the documentation of material selection?

 1. Identifying the type of material
    - Metal
    - Plastic
    - Composite
    - Ceramic
    - etc
2. Environmental impacts
   - recyclability of materials
   - Material properties
