# **Disposal**

*I would like to enable makers to understand the process of discarding (getting rid of) something we no longer need or want.* 

## **How to document a disposal process?**

*Disposal instructions can guide the makers to provide the minimum documentation for disposal of a product or its disposable components*

*The purpose of the disposal process is to remove a system element from the operating environment with the intent of permanently terminating its use; and to deal with any hazardous or toxic materials or waste products following the applicable guidance, policy, regulation, and statutes.*

What does comprise the documentation of disposal instructions?

 1. Identifying the disposable components/ products that are designed for single-use, which means they get discarded ("disposed of") immediately after use. 
 2. Identifying the material of disposable component/ product. Disposable products are most often made from
    - Polystyrene 
    - Plastic
    - Cotton
    - etc.
3. Considering the environmental impacts including
   - Recyclable
   - Non-recyclable
   - Conditionally recyclable: this tells you if any additional steps are required before recycling  the component or product.
   - Negative consequences of the disposable products on the environment if sustainability isn't factored into disposal options.
4. End of life of the product for disposing or recycling
5. Determining what material can be recycled many times
