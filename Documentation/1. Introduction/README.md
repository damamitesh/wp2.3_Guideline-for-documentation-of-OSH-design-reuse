# Introduction

*The introduction aims to provide more details about the project, goal, and its context. Context is defined as “the interrelated conditions in which something exists or occurs”*

## Motivations

*Why are you starting this project?*

```
The project BCN3D Moveo is motivated by the high cost of the materials that undergraduate students must use for learning how to engineer mechatronics systems.
```

## Goals

*What will you deliver in this project?*

```
The project BCN3D Moveo will deliver an open surce robotic arm that everyone will be able to replicate - with or without modification - at home without the need for highly technical knowledge and expensive materials. The robotic arm will support several of the existing training itineraries: mechanical design, automation, industrial programming, etc.
