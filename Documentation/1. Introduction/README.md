# Introduction

*The introduction to the documentation aims to provide more details about the project goal, and context. This introduction should allow the reader to first understand the motivation of the project and also who is involved or has been involved in its creation. As this documaentation structure aims at fostering the reuse of the contents of the project, it is important to understand well the context.*

## Motivations

*This section addresses the question: Why are you starting this project?*

```
As an example, the project BCN3D [BCN3D Moveo](https://github.com/BCN3D/BCN3D-Moveo/) is motivated by the high cost 
of the materials that undergraduate students must use for learning how to engineer mechatronics systems.
```

## Goals

*This section addresses the question: What will be delivered in this project?* 

```
As an example, the project [BCN3D Moveo](https://github.com/BCN3D/BCN3D-Moveo/) is an open source robotic arm 
that everyone should be able to replicate - with or without modification - at home without the need for highly 
technical knowledge and expensive materials. The robotic arm will support several of the existing training itineraries: 
mechanical design, automation, industrial programming, etc.
```

## History

*Here it is welcome to acknowledge the existing sources that have been used in this project with locations?*

```
- Initiators of the original project
- URL of the original project
- URL of other related projects
```

## Documentation structure

*How the documentation is organized?*

```
These guidelines will provide you with a standard structure that is mainly following the product 
life cycle and the technological decomposition. It is implemented in the documentation template available in this project. 
As for example:
- Introduction
- Specification
- Design 
- Manufacturing
- Assembly
- Use
- Maintenance
- Disposal

And inside each of the sections, if required:
- Mechanical
- Electronic 
- Software 

```

## Required skills

*What are the specific knowledge a maker shall own to reuse - with or without modification - your product?*

```
- For example the project echopen need the basic knowledge about the medical ultrasound technology such as ultrasound imaging, 
a matter of acoustical impedance, etc.  
```

## Contribution Process

*Describe here how a maker can contribute to your own project*

```
-  Example of a contribution process:
  -  Post an [issue] and briefly outline the changes you plan to make
  - If you are looking for input on what to contribute, brows the issues with the Requests or Bug label
  - Describe branches
  - Describe what a Pull Request (PR) shall contain (detailed description of changes, summary of test, 
    issue numbers that the PR resolves)
  - Specify code style 
  - Contributor license agreement
```

## Last updates 

*What is the last update of your documentation?*

```
- Last modifiction (date, time, objet of modification, who,...) 
```


## Project team

*Who are the leader of the project?*

```
- Name {E-mail}
```

## License

*What open source hardware license your project complies with?*

```
- License file
```
