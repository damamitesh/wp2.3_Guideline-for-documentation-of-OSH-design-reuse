# **Maintenance**

*I would like to enable makers to understand the process of modifying a system or component after delivery to correct faults, improve performance or other attributes, or adapt to a changed environment.*

## **How to document the Maintenance?**

*Maintenance is strictly connected to the utilization stage of the product or technical system, in which the concept of maintainability must be included. In this scenario, maintainability is considered as the ability of an item, under stated conditions of use, to be retained in or restored to a state in which it can perform its required functions, using prescribed procedures and resources.*
