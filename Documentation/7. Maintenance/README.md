# **Maintenance**

*I would like to enable makers to understand the process of modifying a system or component after delivery to correct faults, improve performance or other attributes, or adapt to a changed environment.*

## **How to document the Maintenance?**

*Maintenance instruction can guide the makers to consider the ability of an item, under stated conditions of use, to be retained in or restored to a state in which it can perform its required functions, using prescribed procedures and resources. A maintenance instruction is a technical communication document intended to give recommendations and information necessary to maintain the system effectively.*
