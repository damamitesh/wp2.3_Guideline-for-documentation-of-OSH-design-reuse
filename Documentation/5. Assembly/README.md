# **Assembly**

*I would like to enable makers to understand the steps of constructing a finished product from components or partially-compiled units.*

## **How to document a assembly or disassembly process?**

*Assembly instruction can guide the makers to follow the process of assembly or disassembly of components of a product.*

### **Assembly instruction** 
<details>
  <summary>Click to see the guideline!</summary>
 
 - **Definition:** *Assembly instruction could illustrate visually and with words and text how to assemble or disassemble the mechanical and electrical components of the product.*


 ```
What does include the content of assembly instruction? 

1. Features
    - What does prepare the assembly of these parts for the final product?
       - Easy attachment point for differential parts 
       - provide the parts to facilitate ability to change, and add new components easily.
       - Etc.
 2. Needed skills for assembly
 3. List of the tools for assembly or disassembly
    - Mandatory
       - Allen Key set
       - Imperial Wrench Set
       - Etc.
    - Optional
       - Laser cutter
       - Etc. 
 4. Identifying the mechanical interfaces/atachements to main body (refer to example of JPL open-source rover)
 5. Describing the machining/ fabrication if it is necessary during the assembly (refer to manufacturing)
    - Machining process
    - Sequence of process
 6. Structral assembly sequence
    - Part list: is a complete list of all parts needed to build the complete product.
       - Item numbers: are based on the assembly structure, that is, the order in which parts are displayed in assembly.
       - Part number or drawing number: which is a reference back to the detail drawing (Refer to the BOM) 
       - Description: is usually a part name or a complete description of parts
       - Quantity: is the number of that particular part used on this assembly. 
       - Image of each part
    - The set of steps necessary to properly assemblme the product
  3. Datasheet of components
    - What a component does?
    - How to use the component?
 4. List of the tools for assemble or disassemble
    - Allen Key set
    - Imperial Wrench Set
    - Etc.
 5. Description of joining technology
    - Screwing
    - Bolting
    - Etc.
 
How to visualize of the assembly or disasembly process?
 1. Images 
 2. Videos
