# **Assembly**

*I would like to enable makers to understand the steps of constructing a finished product from components or partially-compiled units.*

## **How to document a assembly or disassembly process?**

*Assembly instruction can guide the makers to follow the process of assembly or disassembly of components of a product.*

### **Assembly instruction** 
<details>
  <summary>Click to see the guideline!</summary>
 
 - **Definition:** *Assembly instruction could illustrate visually and with words and text how to assemble or disassemble the mechanical and electrical components of the product.*


 ```
What does include the content of assembly instruction? 

1. Assembly sequence
 - The set of steps necessary to properly assemblme the product
 
2. Part list is a complete list of all parts needed to build the complete product and consist of:
    - Item numbers: are based on the assembly structure, that is, the order in which parts are displayed in assembly.
    - Part number or drawing number: which is a reference back to the detail drawing (Refer to the BOM) 
    - Description: is usually a part name or a complete description of parts
    - Quantity: is the number of that particular part used on this assembly. 
    - Image of each part
 3. Datasheet of component
    - What a component does?
    - How to use the component?
 4. List of the tools for assemble or disassemble
    - Allen Key set
    - Imperial Wrench Set
    - Etc.
 5. Description of joining technology
    - Screwing
    - Bolting
    - Etc.
 
How to visualize of the assembly or disasembly process?
 1. Images 
 2. Videos
