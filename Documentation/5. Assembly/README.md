# **Assembly**

*I would like to enable makers to understand the steps of constructing a finished product from components or partially-compiled units.*

## **How to document a assembly process?**

*Assembly instruction could illustrate visually and with words and text how to assemble or disassemble the product and It consists of electrical and mechanical assembly.*

 ### **Assembly instruction can include:** 

 #### *1. Assembly sequences*
 
 #### *2. Part list*
  
  *Part list should provide the information that consist:*
  
  - part name
  - Reference
  - quantity 
  - Image
  - What parts are made?
  - What parts are bought?
  
 #### *3. Datasheet of components*
 
 #### *4. List of the tools for assembly or disassembely*
 
  - Allen Key set
  - Imperial Wrench Set
  - Etc.
 
 #### *5. Description of joining technology*
 
  - screwing
  - bolting
  - etc
 
 #### *6. Visualization of the assembly process*
 
 *It is possible to visualize each part of assembly instruction by providing*

- Images 
- Videos 
- Etc.
