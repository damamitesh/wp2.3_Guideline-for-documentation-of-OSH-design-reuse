*This guideline helps to understand the necessities for assembley documentation. Also, there is a [template](https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/wp2.3_Guideline-for-documentation-of-OSH-design-reuse/blob/main/Documentation/4.%20Manufacturing/README.md#template) below that allows you to fill own assembly documentation.*

# **Assembly**

*I would like to enable makers to understand the steps of constructing a finished product from components or partially-compiled units.*

## **How to document a assembly or disassembly process?**

*Assembly instruction can guide the makers to follow the process of assembly or disassembly of components of a product.*

### **Assembly instruction can include:** 

 - **Definition:** *Assembly instruction could illustrate visually and with words and text how to assemble or disassemble the mechanical and electrical components of the product.*


 ```
Waht does include the content of assembly instruction? 

1. Assembly sequences that identify the different steps of assemblage 
2. Part list consist of:
  - part name
  - Reference
  - quantity 
  - Image of each part
  - Providing procedure 
    - What parts are made?
    - What parts are bought?
 3. Datasheet of component
    - What a component does?
    - How to use the component?
 4. List of the tools for assembly or disassembely
  - Allen Key set
  - Imperial Wrench Set
  - Etc.
 5. Description of joining technology
  - screwing
  - bolting
  - etc
 
How to visualize of the assembly or disasembly process?
  
 1. Images 
 2. Videos 
```  

*Some examples of open-source projects that show the assembly instruction.*
