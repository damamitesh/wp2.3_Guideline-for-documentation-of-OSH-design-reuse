# **Assembly**

*I would like to enable makers to understand the steps of constructing a finished product from components or partially-compiled units.*

## **How to document a assembly process?**

### **1. How does the assembly instruction look like?**

- **Definition:** *The instructions show visually and with words and text how to assemble the product.*

- **Comments:**

  - *Assembly instructions could illustrate assembling the hardware and using the hardware. It consists of electrical and mechanical assembly.*

 ```
  Metadata:
 
- Part list
  - What parts are made?
  - What parts are bought?
- Datasheet of components
- List of the tools for assembly 
- Description of machining and joining technology (drilling, screwing, bolting, etc.)
- Etc.
  ```

### **2. Would you change anything to make the item easier to assemble?**

### **3. How support the visualization of Assembly process?**

- Images 
- Videos 
- Etc.
