# **Assembly**

*I would like to enable makers to understand the steps of constructing a finished product from components or partially-compiled units.*

## **How to document a assembly or disassembly process?**

*Assembly instruction can guide the makers to follow the process of assembly or disassembly of components of a product.*

### **Assembly instruction can include:** 

 - **Definition:** *Assembly instruction could illustrate visually and with words and text how to assemble or disassemble the mechanical and electrical components of the product.*


 ```
Contents of assembly instruction consists: 

1. Assembly sequences that identify the different steps of assemblage 
2. Part list consist of:
  - part name
  - Reference
  - quantity 
  - Image of each part
  - Providing procedure 
    - What parts are made?
    - What parts are bought?
 3. Datasheet of component
