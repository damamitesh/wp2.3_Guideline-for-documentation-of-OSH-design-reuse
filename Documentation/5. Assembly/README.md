# **Assembly**

*I would like to enable makers to understand the steps of constructing a finished product from components or partially-compiled units.* 

## **How to document a assembly or disassembly process?**

*Assembly instruction can guide the makers to follow the process of assembly or disassembly of components of a product.*

### **Assembly instruction** 
<details>
  <summary>Click to see the guideline!</summary>
 
 - **Definition:** *Assembly instruction could illustrate visually and with words and text how to assemble or disassemble the mechanical and electrical components of the product.*


 ```
What does include the content of assembly instruction? 

1. Features
    - What are the features provided by the assembly of parts?
      For example:
       - provide the parts to facilitate ability to change, and add new components easily.
       - Easy attachment point for differential parts 
       - Uses turnbuckles to give multi-degree rotation about 2 separate points, allowing the geometry to be greatly simplified
       - Etc.
 2. Required skills for assembly
    - Operate drilling machine
    - Operate Band Saw/Dremel
    - Etc.
 3. List of the tools for assembly or disassembly
    - Mandatory
       - Allen Key set
       - Imperial wrench set
       - Etc.
    - Optional
       - Drill press
       - Etc. 
 4. Describing the machining/ fabrication if it is necessary during the assembly (refer to manufacturing and see the template below)
    - Machine used
    - Sequence of process
 6. Assembly sequence
    - Part list for mechanical parts: is a complete list of all parts needed to build the complete product(refer to the BOM at manufacturing section)
       - Item numbers: are based on the assembly structure, that is, the order in which parts are displayed in assembly.
       - Part number or drawing number: which is a reference back to the detail drawing (refer to the BOM). 
       - Description: is usually a part name or a complete description of parts.
       - Quantity: is the number of that particular part used on this assembly. 
       - Image of each part
    - Datasheet of components for electronic parts
       - Description of features
          - Core
          - Memeories
          - Advenced connectivity
          - etc.
       - Device summary
          - Reference
          - Part number
       - How to use the component?
    - Describing the machining/ fabrication if it is necessary during the assembly (refer to manufacturing and see the template below)
      - Machine used
      - Sequence of process 
    - The set of steps necessary to properly assemble the parts
    - Identifyin the joining technology in each step
       - Screwing
       - Bolting
       - Soldering
       - Etc.
