# **Assembly**

*I would like to enable makers to understand the steps of constructing a finished product from components or partially-compiled units.*

## **How to document a assembly or disassembly process?**

*Assembly instruction can guide the makers to follow the process of assembly or disassembly of components of a product.*

### **Assembly instruction** 

 - **Definition:** *Assembly instruction could illustrate visually and with words and text how to assemble or disassemble the mechanical and electrical components of the product.*


 ```
What does include the content of assembly instruction? 

1. Assembly sequence
 - The set of steps necessary to properly assemblme the product, including troubleshoouting and potential mistakes
 
2. Part list consist of:
  - part name
  - Reference
  - Quantity 
  - Image of each part
  - Refer to the BOM in section 4. Manufacturing 
 3. Datasheet of component
    - What a component does?
    - How to use the component?
 4. List of the tools for assemble or disassemble
  - Allen Key set
  - Imperial Wrench Set
  - Etc.
 5. Description of joining technology
  - Screwing
  - Bolting
  - Etc.
 
How to visualize of the assembly or disasembly process?
  
 1. Images 
 2. Videos
