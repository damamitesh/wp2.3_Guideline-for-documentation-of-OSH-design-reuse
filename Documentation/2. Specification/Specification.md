# **Specification**

2

​

3

The specification consists in describing the product with a "black box" external view to capture the intermediate technical objects (stakeholders, external interfaces, services, and constraints) that serve to, *in fine*, elucidate the product requirements.

## **Stakeholders:**

6

​

7

*What entities influence the product throughout its life cycle ?*

- **Comments:**

​

11

  - A stakeholder is not necessarily a person (e.g. considering airports as a stakeholder when designing a two-deck aircraft).

12

  - A stakeholder can indirectly affect the product (e.g. considering neighborhood when designing a nuclear power plant).

13

  - A stakeholder can indirectly be affected by the product (e.g. considering the local biodiversity when designing an airport).

## **External interfaces**

24

​

25

- **Definition:**  External interfaces are interactions between the product and the stakeholders.

26

- **Comments:**

27

  - An interface is made of a port (in, out, or in-out)

28

  - An interface is made of a flow (matter, energy, or signal)

29

- **Metadata**:

30

  - N/A

## **Service *(synonyms: external function, capability)* **

33

​

34

- **Definition:** A service is an effect intended by a stakeholder resulting from the interaction of the product with its environment (i.e. what the  product is for).

35

- **Comments:**

36

  - Services provides users with and exchange value that can be included in an economic system (e.g. airlines buy flight hours).

37

  - Services are intended effects that can observed from outside the product ("back box" external view), but not from outside an internal component ("white box" internal view).

38

  - Services are defined in a solution neutral way.

39

  - Services can be stated as follows : The [Product] shall enable [Stakeholder] [Action verb] (e.g. The product shall enable end-user to clean its teeths)

40

- **Metadata:**

41

  - Action verb (we often reason in terms of action verbs to communicate expected behaviours, so it would be nice to be able to search designs with action verbs)

42

43

## **Constraint *(Synonyms: non function requirement)* **
