# **Manufacturing**

*I would like to enable makers to understand the process by which raw materials transform into a final product.*

## **How to document a manufacturing process?**

### **1. What manufacturing technology do you use?**

- **Definition:** *Manufacturing technology means all the machinery, equipment and processes that are used to manufacture products.*

- **Comments:**

  - *One of the main advantages of manufacturing technology is quality enhancement.*
  - *Manufacturing technologies help boost operational productivity in various ways. They remarkably increase flexibility by giving manufacturers the option to “have it their way”.*
