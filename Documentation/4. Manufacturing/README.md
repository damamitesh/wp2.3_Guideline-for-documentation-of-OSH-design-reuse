# **Manufacturing**

*I would like to enable makers to understand the process by which raw materials transform into a final product.*

## **How to document a manufacturing process?**

### **What are the manufacturing instructions to make the product?**

- **Definition:** Manufacturing Instructions means full descriptions and instructions concerning raw materials usage, operating conditions, process and quality standards to be employed in the manufacture of products.*

 Manufacturing instruction could include: 
 
1. Manufacturing technology means all the machinery, equipment and processes that are used to manufacture products. So,documentation of manufacturing technology consists

  - Manufacturing process and operation  
     - 3D printing stereo lithography
     - Wire cutting
     - Laser cutting
     - CNC machinig 
     - Milling
     - Drilling
     - Grinding
     - etc.
   - Machine name
   - Manufacturing tools 
   - Machine parameters
   
2. The standard file formats support rapid prototyping, 3D printing, and the surface geometry of a 3D design without the possibility for modification. The standard design file formats include: 
  - CAD files in an interchange format (STL format)
  - 2D drawings (SVG or JPEG)
  - Manufacturing export formats (G-code, STEP-NC)
  - Circuit board design formats (Gerber RS-274X
  - Excellon file
    
4. Reference of material selection
 
5. Post-processing and its tool kit. For example: 
    - Sanding after 3D printing
    - Cold welding
    - Gap filling
    - Polishing
    - Priming and painting
    - Etc.  
6. Bill of material (BOM) that consists:
  - Part number
  - Item name
  - Description
  - Quantity
  - cost
  - Etc.

- Etc.
