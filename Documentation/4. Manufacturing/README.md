# **Manufacturing**

*I would like to enable makers to understand the process by which raw materials transform into a final product.*

## **How to document a manufacturing process?**

### **What are the manufacturing instructions to make the product?**

**Definition:** *Manufacturing Instructions means full descriptions and instructions concerning raw materials usage, operating conditions, process and quality standards to be employed in the manufacture of products.*


 *Manufacturing instruction could include:* 
 
*1. Manufacturing technology means all the machinery, equipment and processes that are used to manufacture products. So,documentation of manufacturing technology consists*

   - Machine tool is a machine for handling or machining metal or other rigid materials, usually by
    - Turning tools
    - Milling tools
    - Grinding tools
    - Cutting tools
    - Drilling tools
    - Boring tools
    - etc. 
  - Manufacturing process and its machine name  
     - 3D printing stereo lithography
     - Wire cutting
     - Burning machining technology 
       - Laser cutting
       - Plasma cutting
     - Computerized machining technology 
       - CNC machinig 
     - Machining process technology
       - Milling
       - Drilling
       - Grinding
     - etc.
   - Machining parameters are all those parameters that are inherent to any machining operation and should have a suitable finite value to smooth and efficient removal of materials.
     - Cutting velocity
     - Feed rate
     - Depth of cut
     - Etc.
   
*2. The standard file formats support rapid prototyping, 3D printing, and the surface geometry of a design without the possibility for modification. The standard design file formats include:*
 
  - CAD files in an interchange format such as STL format that is suitable for 3D priniting 
  - 2D drawings like SVG or JPEG
  - Manufacturing export formats such as G-code, STEP-NC
  - Circuit board design formats such as Gerber RS-274X, excellon 
    
*3. Describe nominal geometry and its allowable variation by using symbolic language on drawing  such as Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T). It cab define in [2D drawing native files](https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/wp2.3_template/blob/main/Documentation/3.%20Design/Structural%20model/Mechanics/README.md#2-modelling-a-design-in-native-file-format)*

4. Material selection
 
6. Post-processing and its tool kit. For example: 
    - Sanding after 3D printing
    - Cold welding
    - Gap filling
    - Polishing
    - Priming and painting
    - Etc.  
7. Bill of material (BOM) that consists:
   - Part number
   - Item name
   - Description
   - Quantity
   - cost
   - Etc.

- Etc.

### **How to support the visualization of the manufacturing process?**

 ```

 
- Images 
- Videos 
- Etc.
