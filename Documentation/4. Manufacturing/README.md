# **Manufacturing**

*I would like to enable makers to understand the process by which raw materials transform into a final product.*

## **How to document a manufacturing process?**

### **1. What manufacturing technology do you use?**

- **Definition:** *Manufacturing technology means all the machinery, equipment and processes that are used to manufacture products.*

- **Comments:**

  - *One of the main advantages of manufacturing technology is quality enhancement.*
  - *Manufacturing technologies help boost operational productivity in various ways. They remarkably increase flexibility by giving manufacturers the option to “have it their way”.*

  Metadata:
 
- 3D printing stereo lithography
- Wire cutting 
- Laser cutting
- CNC
- Etc. 
  ```
#### *Example:* [JPL Open Source Rover](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover/tree/master/mechanical/body_assembly#3-machiningfabrication) 

### **2. What are the manufacturing instructions to make the product?**

- **Definition:** Manufacturing Instructions means full descriptions and instructions concerning raw materials usage, operating conditions, process and quality standards to be employed in the manufacture of products.*

 ```
  Metadata:
 
- Manufacturing sequences and its tool kit.
  - First process
    - Process name
    - Machine parameters (For example: Milling, Drilling, Tapping, etc.)
  - Second process
  - Third process
  - ...
  - Post processing and its tool kit. For example: 
    - Sanding after 3D printing
    - Cold welding
    - Gap filling
    - Polishing
    - Priming and painting
    - Etc.  
- Bill of material (BOM) that consists:
  - Part number
  - Item name
  - Description
  - Quantity
  - cost
  - Etc.
- Reference of material selection
- Etc. 
  ```
  
#### *Example:* [SatNOGS Rotator v3](https://wiki.satnogs.org/SatNOGS_Rotator_v3#Build_Sequence) 

### **3. How support the visualization of manufacturing process?**

 ```
  Metadata:
 
- Images 
- Videos 
- Etc.
