# **Behavioral model**

*I would like to enable the makers to understand the analysis of the physical behavior of a product to support the decision made at the latter stages of design.* 

## **What is a behavioral model?**

* An opportunity to describe the behavior a product when it receives a stimulus.
* The behavior model could be the mathematical description of the physical product.
* The behavior model is the physical interactions between the components of a design as well as between the design and its environment. An artifact exhibits certain behaviors not only by the change or maintaining of its physical state but also by several interactions that take place inside the artifact, as well as with its environment.


## **Why should you define behavioral model?**

* The behavioral model identifies the properties for understanding the calculation, simulation, component, and environment of the product.
* Behavior model describes how the artifact implements its function and is managed by engineering principles and physical rules that are included in a behavioral model.  
* Behavioral perspective gives a description of system dynamics. The main concepts in behavioral perspective are states and transitions between states.
* Behavioral model provides the simulation of any given physical phenomenon using the numerical techniques.
