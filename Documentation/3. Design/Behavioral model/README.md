# **Behavioral model**

*I would like to enable the makers to understand the analysis of the physical behavior of a product to support the decision made at the latter stages of design.* 

## **What is a behavioral model?**

* An opportunity to describe the behavior a product when it receives a stimulus.
* Behavior is the attributes that can be derived from the design objectâ€™s structure.
* Behavior model is the mathematical description of the physical product.
* Behavior model is the physical interactions between the components of a design as well as between the design and its environment. An artifact exhibits certain behaviors not only by the change or maintaining of its physical state, but also by a number of interactions that take place inside the artifact, as well as with its environment.


## **Why should you define behavioral model?**

* Behavior is the relationship between the independent state variable and the dependent state variable
* Behavioral model identifies the properties for understanding the calculation, simulation, component and environment of product.
* Behavior model describes how the artifact implements its function and is managed by engineering principles and physical rules that are included in a behavioral model.  
* Behavioral perspective gives a description of system dynamics. The main concepts in behavioral perspective are states and transitions between states.
* Behavioral model provides the simulation of any given physical phenomenon using the numerical techniques.
