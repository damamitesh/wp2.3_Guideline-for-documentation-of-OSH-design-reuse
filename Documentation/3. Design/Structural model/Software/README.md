## **How to document the software section of a project?**

 ### **1. Software architecture**

*The software architecture represents the repository details of all the software that is necessary for reusing and running the project.*
 

#### *Example of software architecture of* [PX4 Vision](https://docs.px4.io/master/en/concept/architecture.html#px4-architectural-overview) 


#### *[Template of software architecture](https://app.diagrams.net/?libs=general;uml#G1MlfmgE-MK0jfELJd3EfE1epv03GCdpde)*

 ### **2. Documentation of different parts of software**

 ```
*This part based on the different products could include*

- Description of programming algorithm   
- The source code. 
- Version of software
 ```

### *Examples:* 

*1. [Nasa-JPL](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover/tree/master/software)*

*2. [AmboVent](https://github.com/AmboVent-1690-108/AmboVent/tree/master/3-Software)*
