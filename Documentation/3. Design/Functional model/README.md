***I would like to** to enble makers to understand what the product and its parts are for.* 

## **What is a functional model?**

* A description of the functions performed by a product.
* An opportunity to break down a product into smaller pieces that can be more easily understood.
* At the highest level of a functional breakdown (black box view), service functions are the effects (intended by its stakeholders) of the interaction of the product with its environment.[Specification](https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/wp2.3_template/tree/main/Documentation/2.%20Specification#specification)
* At the intermediate and lowest levels of a functional breakdown (white box view), technical functions are input-output relationships transforming matter, energy or information flows. They are expressing in a non-solution neutral way and observable from inside the product. A set of technical function is necessary for the realization of a service function.
