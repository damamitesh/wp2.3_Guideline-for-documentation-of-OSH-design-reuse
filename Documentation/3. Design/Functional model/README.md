# **Functional model**

***I would like to** to enble makers to understand what the product and its parts are for.* 

## **What is a functional model?**

* A description of the functions performed by a product.
* An opportunity to break down a product into smaller pieces that can be more easily understood.
* At the highest level of a functional breakdown (black box view), service functions are the effects (intended by its stakeholders) of the interaction of the product with its environment.([Specification](https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/wp2.3_template/tree/main/Documentation/2.%20Specification#specification))
* At the intermediate and lowest levels of a functional breakdown (white box view), technical functions are input-output relationships transforming matter, energy or information flows. They are expressing in a non-solution neutral way and observable from inside the product. A set of technical function is necessary for the realization of a service function.

## **Why should you define functional model?**

* A functional model helps to break down a complicated problem into simple sub-problems.
* A functional model helps to anticipate failures occurring when an intended effect of the product is no longer produced on its environment.
* A function is the main input to derive the functional requirements required to define the conditions of use of the product as well as to provide objective evidences through the validation and verification activities.
