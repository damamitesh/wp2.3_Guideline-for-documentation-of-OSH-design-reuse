# Product model

*This chapter concentrates on the documentation of product models. Product models serve to answer questions that interest multiple views on the product. Among the product views, there is an agreed-upon ontology of product models named Function-Behaviour-Structure (FBS) where:*

- **Function (F)** stands for **“what the object is for”.**
- **Behaviour (B)** stands for **“what the object does”.**
- **Structure (S)** stands for **“what the object consists of”.**
