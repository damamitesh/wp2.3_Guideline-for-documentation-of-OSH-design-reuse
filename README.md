# **Context**

## **Product Models**

This chapter concentrates on the documentation of product models. Product models serve to answer questions that interest multiple views on the product. Among the product views, there is an agreed-upon ontology of product models named Function-Behaviour-Structure (FBS) where:

<span style="color:blue">some *blue* text</span>.

Function (F) stands for “what the object is for”.
•	Behaviour (B) stands for “what the object does”.
•	Structure (S) stands for “what the object consists of”.

> ## **_Functional Models_**

> > ### _Stakeholders_

> > ### _Service Functions_

At the highest level of a functional breakdown (white box view), service functions are the effects (intended by its stakeholders) of the interaction of the product with its environment. They are expressed in a solution neutral way and observable from outside the product.

> > ### _Constraints_

> > ### _Technical Functions_

At the intermediate and lowest levels of a functional breakdown (black box view), technical functions are input-output relationships transforming matter, energy or information flows. They are expressing in a non-solution neutral way and observable from inside the product. A set of technical function is necessary for the realization of a service function.
