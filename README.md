# Introduction

## Motivations

*Why did we start this documentation for design reuse project?*



This project is motivated by the poor documentation practices observed in web-based open source hardware projects. Indeed, the lack of standardised open source hardware documentation guidelines make the reuse - with or without modification - of the solution cumbersome.

## Goals

*What does this project provide?*



This project delivers a template standing as a minimum viable documentation for open source hardware. By cloning this repository, any maker will be able to fill in the template provided in the folder entitled "Documentation".

## History

*What are the existing sources that have inspired this project?*



The documentation template reuses exemplary documentation practices borrowed from:

- [NASA JPL Open Source Rover Project](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover) - section "Skills Necessary"
- ...

## Required Background

*What are the specific knowledge prerequisite a maker should have in order to create his own documentation based on this project?*



To reuse this project, the maker should know how to:

- [Clone a GIT repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

- [Edit a Markdown file](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
