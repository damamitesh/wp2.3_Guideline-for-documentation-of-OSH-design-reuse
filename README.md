This project aims at testing on a case study the template for design reuse. This template is based on three main models that describe the product and allow to understand:
  - the context of use and the stakholders
  - the interactions between the stakholders and the product (the functions)
  - the interactions between the product and its environment (the constraints)
  - the requirements
  - the technical functions 
  - the implementation and the architecture of the product
  - the behavior of the product (structural, kinematic, logic...)
  - the requirements for manufacturing (quality, tolerancing, machines, technology...)
  - the requirements for assembly (techniques, sequences, machines)
  - the materials requirements (recycle materials, raw material, quality, alternatives...)
  - the dismantle requirements and procedures
  - the recycle and reuse posibilities
  - to be completed...
