# Introduction

*Smart charging indicator for your home. The device can display the charging status of your electric car, wherever you need it. It can even remind you to plug in.
The integrated plant fully offsets the CO2 needed to power the device.*

## Motivations

```
The idea was to build a device for your home (kitchen shelf, living room) that can display the status of your electric car. So you don't have to grab your phone and check an app. Sometimes people forget to plug in, or a charging error occurs and the car is not sufficiently charged the next morning. This does not need to happen. The PowerPlanter can show the status all the time. 
```

## Goals


```
The PowerPlanter is an innovative device created as part of the "Sion Parts for future" challenge. It can show you the state of charge of your Sion electric car (white: fully charged), any charging errors (red light), if its charging with grid energy (blue) or just with the integrated solar cells (yellow). It can even show if you Sion is providing energy via bidirectional charging (green). 
The plant in the PowerPlanter will offset the CO2 emissions of the standby power requirements of the device to make it carbon neutral.
