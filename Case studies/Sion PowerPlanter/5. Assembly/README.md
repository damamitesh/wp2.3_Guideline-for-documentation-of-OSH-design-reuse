 #### 1. Assembly sequences 
 solder the neopixel to the ESP32. You just need to connect three wires to the pins GND, 5V and data input. Here is a small video to show you what needs to be done in this step:

 In a true "Sion solar car" fashion we connect the cables to the Neopixel from the back.
The neopixel has five connectors, you just need 5V, GND and "Data In":

Next, solder the wires to the ESP32 D1 Mini:

   * GND (Neopixel) to GND (ESP32)
   * 5V (Neopixel) to VCC (ESP32)
   * Data In (Neopixel) to IO33 (ESP32)
