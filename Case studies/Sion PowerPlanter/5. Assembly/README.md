## Assembly of the electronics

#### 1. Assembly sequences 

 Solder the neopixel to the ESP32. You just need to connect three wires to the pins GND, 5V and data input. Here is a small video to show you what needs to be done in this step:

 In a true "Sion solar car" fashion we connect the cables to the Neopixel from the back.
The neopixel has five connectors, you just need 5V, GND and "Data In":

Next, solder the wires to the ESP32 D1 Mini:

   * GND (Neopixel) to GND (ESP32)
   * 5V (Neopixel) to VCC (ESP32)
   * Data In (Neopixel) to IO33 (ESP32)

  * 3 short wires to connect the ESP32 to the jewel (5V, about 5 cm each)
  * a leftover charger (micro USB) to power the ESP32, 500mA or more (1A is best)

 #### 3. Assembly tools 
   * glue gun
   * a leftover charger (micro USB) to power the ESP32, 500mA or more (1A is best)
  
#### 4. Joining technology 
  - Screwing
  - Bolting
  - Etc.


## Assembly of the device

#### 1. Assembly sequences 

Assembly is quite straightforward. First, pull the USB cable trough the hole.

Next, attach the ESP32 / Neopixel combo and pull back the cable. The ESP32 should stay at the bottom. You may use the glue gun to attach it in place.

Next, use the glue gun to attach the neopixel to the larger hole from the inside. If it does not fit exacly, it does not matter, no one will see it. Then attach the diffusor lens on the outside, also by using the glue gun:

Lastly, we need to cover the wires to prevent shortcuts. You can glue the 3d printed shape over the neopixel, or just use duct tape. This will fix it, like always.

Finally, grab the dariol metal form, and place it in the powerplanter. Done.
