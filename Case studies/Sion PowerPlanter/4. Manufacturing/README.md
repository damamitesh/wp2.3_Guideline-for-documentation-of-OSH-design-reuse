#### Manufacturing technology
  1. Machine tool
     * N/A
  2. Manufacturing process
     * 3D printing: The case can be printed by any 3D printer. You need about 75g of filament, less than 2 â‚¬ of material. Printing time is 2-4 hours depending on quality. I desiged the case with very few details, so it can be printed in a low quality setting and still looks good.
  3. Machining parameters
     * N/A
  4. Vizualization via images and videos
     * N/A
   
 #### Identifying the geometry by standard file formats
