#### Manufacturing technology
  1. Machine tool
     * N/A
  2. Manufacturing process
     * 3D printing: The case can be printed by any 3D printer. You need about 75g of filament, less than 2 â‚¬ of material. Printing time is 2-4 hours depending on quality. I desiged the case with very few details, so it can be printed in a low quality setting and still looks good.

 #### Identifying the geometry by standard file formats
  1. [3D CAD files](https://wikifactory.com/@boettger/powerplanter/files/3D%20printer%20cad%20files) in an interchange format for 3D priniting
    
 #### Material selection
   * Name of material
       * white filament 
   * Characteristic: N/A
  
 #### Post-processing
 
   * Paint the enclosure
 
 If you want some special color, or want to improve the fit and finish of the enclosure, you can paint the case by using acrylic color or spray paint. First, sand the case a little by using sand paper (start with 120, then 240 and 320).

I use the hole in the bottom to hold the form in place while painting or spraying. After the case has the desired color, you can continue.
