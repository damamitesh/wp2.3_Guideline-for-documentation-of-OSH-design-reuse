## Motivations

```
Sion Phone Holder (SPH) is tailor made phone holder for Sono Sion. Device will keep your phone conveniently positioned in the middle of your dashboard.Thanks to two axis adjustment, everyone can find a comfortable viewing angle. Magnetic head unit together with your mobile’s metal plate gives you freedom to set the position – horizontal or vertical and allows you to attach or detach your device with ease. 
```

## Goals


```
We have created SPH not only from our personal needs but also were listening customers wishes. Nowadays, 99% of automakers designs interior of their products, forgetting about mobile devices. If you are lucky and have a car with dedicated mobile’s place, it’s either for iPhone only or your device is too big to fit nicely. Not mentioning about the position – usually it’s somewhere in the bottom, not within eyes reach. We think it’s not right. We want to change that!
