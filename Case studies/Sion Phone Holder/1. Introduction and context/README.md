## Motivations

```
Sion Phone Holder (SPH) is tailor made phone holder for Sono Sion. Device will keep your phone conveniently positioned in the middle of your dashboard.Thanks to two axis adjustment, everyone can find a comfortable viewing angle. Magnetic head unit together with your mobile’s metal plate gives you freedom to set the position – horizontal or vertical and allows you to attach or detach your device with ease. 
```

## Goals


```
We have created SPH not only from our personal needs but also were listening customers wishes. Nowadays, 99% of automakers designs interior of their products, forgetting about mobile devices. If you are lucky and have a car with dedicated mobile’s place, it’s either for iPhone only or your device is too big to fit nicely. Not mentioning about the position – usually it’s somewhere in the bottom, not within eyes reach. We think it’s not right. We want to change that!
```

## History

```
There is quite a story behind our product. It all started with simple idea.
```

When it was initially accepted, we started with some ideas.
Universal gopro mount implemented in phone holder.

It all brought us to first rough 3D concept.

It gave us idea about the size and most comfortable position in the car. So we put into this a bit of engineering process and end up with a phone holder which have not only one but limitless position across Sion’s IP decorative bar. Thanks to that, it’s possible to put additional holder for your passenger or in the future, install some other appliances.
