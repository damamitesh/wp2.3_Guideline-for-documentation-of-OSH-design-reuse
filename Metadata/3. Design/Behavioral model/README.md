### Metadata

#### *1. Simulation model name* 
- **Definition:** *A simulation model enables the designers to test whether the design specifications are met by performing computer simulations rather than experiments on the physical prototype. It promises a more comprehensive exploration of design alternatives and a better-performing final design.*
   - Mechanical simulation
   - Physical simulation
   - Thermo-mechanical simulation
   - Electronical simulations
   - Etc.
