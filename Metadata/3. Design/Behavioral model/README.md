### Metadata

#### *1. Simulation model name* 
- **Definition:** *A simulation model enables the designers to test whether the design specifications are met by performing computer simulations rather than experiments on the physical prototype. It promises a more comprehensive exploration of design alternatives and a better-performing final design.*
   - Mechanical simulation
   - Physical simulation
   - Thermo-mechanical simulation
   - Electronical simulations
   - Etc.
 
 #### *2. Model definition* 
   - Geometrical model: An editable file format is a standard way that information is encoded for storage and allow the makers to study, modify the geometry of a model and reuse it.
       - Native formats
          - .FCStd format 
       - Neutral formats 
          - STEP formats
   - Material characteristics: the characteristics of the materials are those that identify the reactions of materials reactions to heat, electricity, light, force, etc.   
       - Mechanical characteristics
         - Hardness
         - Elasticity 
         - Plasticity
         - Toughness
         - Etc. 
       - Thermal characteristics 
         - Melting point
         - Thermal conductivity 
         - Etc.
       - Electrical characteristics
         - Corrosion resistance
         - Surface tension
         - Etc.
  - Initial conditions 
       - Initial stresses
       - Temperature
       - Velocities
       - Etc.
  - Boundary conditions: can be imposed on individual solution variables   
       - Displacements
       - Rotations
       - Etc.
  - Kinematic constraints: are several of the fundamental solution variables in the model
       - Linear constraint equations
       - Multi-point constraints
       - Etc.
  - Interactions: that are contact and other interactions between parts can be defined

#### *3. Name of open-source software*
- **Definition:** *It consists the type of open-source software to simulate a gemotrical model.*
   - Open Modelica
   - ADINA
   - Etc.
